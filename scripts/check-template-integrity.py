"""Check the rendering pipeline for defects that only surface at run time.

Both defect classes this catches were found in this repo by hand:

  - a task referencing a variable defined nowhere (`task template:tidy` had
    referenced an undefined TEMPLATE_NODE_CONFIG_FILE for months)
  - a field whose schema default disagrees with the render-time default
    (cluster_svc_cidr was 10.43.0.0/16 in CUE and 10.96.0.0/16 in plugin.py)
  - a `db_storage_class` naming a class this cluster will not install
    (ferry133/jg-cluster-template#1)

None is visible by reading a single file, so check them instead of
rediscovering them later.

Three outcomes, not two: `ok`, `FAIL`, and `skip` for a check whose subject is
not present. A check that cannot see what it is checking must not print the same
word as one that looked and found nothing wrong.

Usage: check-template-integrity.py [repo-root]
